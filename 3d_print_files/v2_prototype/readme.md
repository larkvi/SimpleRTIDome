# SimpleRTIDome v2 print files

There are four files in this directory:
- 	SimpleRTIDome_11cm_bare_210mmfootprint v6.stl is the current 3D printing file for the dome with integrated Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 mounnting plate
-   SimpleRTIDome_11cm_noplate_210mmfootprint_v6.stl is the current 3D printing file with no mounting plate for the RasPi camera, just a hole. It is more suitable for use with a DSLR with a macro lens.
-   LED Sleeve v4.stl is the file for printing the LED sleeves. Though 41 are needed, it is probably better to print extras in case you ruin one during the cleaning (we didn't, but just in case). Due to its small size, it is probably advantageous to print plates of them separately from the main dome.
-   SimpleRTI_LaserCutter_BasePlate.dxf is an untested (at your own risk! let me know if it works!) laser file for laser cutting a base with markings for the alignment holes and a measuring plate for the field of view of the Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 in its installed state.

The prints were sized for a 210mm footprint, but this unfortunately means that in their current configuration, the travel lines of the printer head will be outside the printable area of a 210mm printer. This will hopefully be rectified in the next model. I used black PETG for the v2 test print, to good effect.
