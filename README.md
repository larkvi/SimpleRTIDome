# SimpleRTIDome

A GitHub supporting and documenting a simple—and inexpensive—DIY camera-agnostic (and hopefully soon, camera-integrated) Refectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) dome, suitable for teaching and experimentation.

3D printing files have been uploaded for the v2 version of the prototype. These files work, but are due to be rebuilt shortly to amend small issues. Due to delays in receiving parts from China, the v3 version (hopefully the release version) is not expected until June 2024 at the earliest. If you have interest or feedback, please feel free to use the issues or email me.

More information and build plans will be posted shortly.
