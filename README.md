# SimpleRTIDome

A GitHub supporting and documenting a simple—and inexpensive—DIY camera-agnostic (and hopefully soon, camera-integrated) Refectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) dome, suitable for teaching and experimentation.

More information and build plans will come as we get more feedback on the current prototype.
